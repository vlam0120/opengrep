;; Comprehensive HOF test for Clojure: Custom and built-in higher-order functions
;; Tests taint flow from source() to sink() across multiple HOF scenarios.

;; ===== Custom HOF Functions =====

;; Single-arity HOF that calls its callback with a value
(defn direct-call [callback value]
  (callback value))

;; Delegates to built-in (tests ToSinkInCall propagation)
(defn custom-map-builtin [arr callback]
  (map callback arr))

;; HOF that applies callback to each element (loop style)
(defn custom-for-each [callback coll]
  (doseq [item coll]
    (callback item)))

(defn custom-filter [arr callback]
  (filter callback arr))

;; Multi-arity HOF: 1-arity delegates to 2-arity
(defn multi-arity-call
  ([x] (multi-arity-call x nil))
  ([x y]
   ;; todoruleid: test-hof-taint
   (sink x)))

;; ===== Custom HOF with named callbacks =====

  (sink x))
